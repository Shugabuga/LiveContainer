/// behind it, the folder's name in large type, and its icons on a frosted
/// panel in the middle of the screen. It zooms out of the folder's icon when
/// it appears and back into it when it closes: the glass grows from the
/// icon's frame and corners to the panel's, each icon from its small place
/// on the folder's icon to its place on the panel, and the rest fades. A tap
/// beside the panel closes it.
///
/// HomeFolderZoom draws the icons while the folder zooms; the panel's own
/// icons, with their buttons and gestures, show once it is out. While an
/// icon dragged out of the folder is still moving, the panel stays, hidden,
/// since that icon's drag lives in it.
