// Puts the Home button over an app zContainer runs, and takes the person back
// to zContainer when they press it. zContainer turned into the app when it
// opened it, so going back means opening zContainer again with no app chosen:
// LCSharedUtils' launchToGuestAppWithClassicMode:, as the Home Screen uses to
// open apps, which zContainer's launch takes as a request for its own screens.
// First it tells the app it is going to the background (LCAppDeparture), as
// pressing Home on the iPhone does, so the app can save before it ends.
//
// TweakLoader starts it in every app zContainer runs itself. It stays out of
// apps in multitask windows (LiveProcess), which zContainer's windows already
// frame, and out of apps whose settings turn the Home button off.
